  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>My research studies state-formation in developing societies, tracing the macro-level processes that drive variation in the postcolonial world. I draw on a regional expertise in the Middle East and North Africa, 
  and a broad archival and historical engagement with the postcolonial world more broadly to study the relationship between contention, educational supply, status and cleavage construction.</p>

  <p>Current and published research projects have explored Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Turkey. I have published co-authored work with H.E. Ceyhun at <em>Mediterranean Politics</em>.</p>

  <p>In my dissertation, <em>Fellahin into Frenchmen: Social Control and Educational Supply in the Postcolonial Maghreb</em>, I demonstrate that leaders in Tunisia and Morocco withheld secondary education from regions linked to colonial era rebellions in Morocco and Tunisia after independence.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to be advised by Amaney Jamal, Mark Beissinger, and Elizabeth Nugent.</p>
