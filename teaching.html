  <p>
    At Princeton, I have been privileged to serve as an Associate Instructor for courses in comparative politics. I have precepted:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>POL 230 – Introduction to Comparative Politics</strong> (Prof. Andreas Wiedemann)</li>
    <li><strong>POL 366 – Politics in Africa</strong> (Prof. Jennifer Widner)</li>
    <li><strong>POL 379 – Politics in Southeast Asia</strong> (Prof. Nick Kuipers)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Throughout these experiences, I have sought to bring my regional expertise and lived experience in North Africa into the classroom. I excel as both a lecturer and a precept facilitator, creating spaces that are dynamic, informed, and inclusive.
