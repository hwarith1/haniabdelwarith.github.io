    <h1>Teaching</h1>

    <p>
      At Princeton, I have been privileged to serve as an Associate Instructor for courses in comparative politics. I have precepted for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>POL 230 – Introduction to Comparative Politics</strong> (Prof. Andreas Wiedemann). Spring 2023. </li>
      <li><strong>POL 366 – Politics in Africa</strong> (Prof. Jennifer Widner). Fall 2022. </li>
      <li><strong>POL 379 – Politics in Southeast Asia</strong> (Prof. Nick Kuipers). Spring 2025. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Throughout these experiences, I have sought to bring my regional expertise and lived experience in North Africa into the classroom. I excel as both a lecturer and a precept facilitator, creating spaces that are dynamic, informed, and inclusive.

      I have excelled as an instructor averaging a 4.54/5 across the 6 sections I have taught. I am constantly looking for ways to grow as an instructor and scientific communicator.

      "I've had very few classes where I actually wanted to attend the precepts each week, but I always felt that your precepts were full of information and insights." – POL 379
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "Hani was always well prepared, the slides were content-packed, and I especially enjoyed how discussions were sometimes guided by student questions in discussion posts – made me feel a part of how the course was run!" – POL 379
